<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Potassium sodium niobate (K0.48Na0.52NbO3), also known as KNN, has emerged as a promising lead-free ceramic material due to its high piezoelectric coefficient up to 160 pC/N undoped, and its elevated Curie temperature above 400 °C. Additionally, its photocatalytic properties make it a strong candidate for applications combining it with piezoelectricity, known as piezo-photocatalysis. This type of catalysis is mostly used for environmental remediation, such as organic dye degradation like Rhodamine B (RhB). This study aims to develop composite materials by combining KNN particles with polyacrylonitrile (PAN), a polymer with excellent mechanical properties, and scalable synthesis via electrospinning, to enhance dye degradation performance.</p><p>Briscoe and Prof. Ana Belén Jorge Sobrido, for being my guidance on my way to the Dark Side.</p><p>All my gratitude, love and acknowledgement go to my family, Eloy aka Bebé Gerber Joge Egviro, my mom Ofelia aka Laurita Garza, my dad Eloy aka Afedo, for being by my side even though an ocean separated our bodies, and to Oma and Opa as well. And an incredibly special place in my heart, and to whom I dedicate this thesis, Abuelito Alejandro, who taught me that being a scientist was one of the coolest things I could do, and who now will guide me from whichever place he rests.</p><p>I also want to thank my forever supporter and best friend, America. Thank you for being present in the distance. Thank you, Aarsha, for being such a lovely company while discovering London.</p><p>How could I not acknowledge the impact that my London family had in me, from my group pals:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The composite materials were synthesized using solid-state reaction for KNN and electrospinning for KNN-PAN fibers. Six samples, including two control groups (pristine PAN and KNN powder) and four composites with varying KNN loads based on the PAN content (10, 20, 30 and 40 wt%), were tested for their ability to degrade RhB using piezo-, photo-and piezo-photocatalysis.</p><p>With Rietveld refinement analysis, the existence of the orthorhombic phase in KNN powder was obtained with values of  2 = 3.78, and R factors of Rwp = 10.1 and Rexp = 5.19, after reducing the calcination temperature from 900 °C to 800 °C, and composite fibers were successfully electrospinned with ceramic particles. The required size for the particles was 100 nanometers, using ceramic powder from a post-calcination milling treatment. The KNN optical band gap was determined to be 3.94 eV, reduced to 3.92 eV after 12 hours of the post-calcination milling.</p><p>The most efficient samples for RhB degradation were the 10 wt% KNN composite, achieving 76.71% in piezocatalysis, and the 30 wt% KNN composite, with a degradation efficiency of 71.23% in photocatalysis. Finally, the KNN powder showed an enhanced piezo-photocatalytic activity with 54.02% degradation after three hours of testing. Notably, the 20 wt% KNN composite produced a significant color change in RhB, reaching the second place in piezo-photocatalysis after the ceramic powder, with a 45.46% degradation efficiency, suggesting its potential for enhanced degradation mechanisms even after five cycles.    </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rwp</head><p>Weighted profile R factor (Rietveld refinement) Piezoelectricity is a property of materials whose crystalline structure is noncenter-symmetric, when applying mechanical stress or strain produces an electrical response, and vice versa: when an electric field is applied, there is a mechanical deformation. This property is directly linked to the Curie temperature (TC), a phase transition temperature, where materials lose their piezoelectricity by modifying their crystalline structure <ref type="bibr">[2][2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SEM</head><p>During the Second World War, barium titanate (BaTiO3, abbreviated as BT)</p><p>was used for the construction of sonar and radar devices due to its dielectric constant, K (between 1200 and 1500) and its Curie temperature (120 °C).</p><p>Unfortunately, its relatively low TC makes the use of BT in other possible applications difficult <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>3. In 1952, lead zirconate titanate, abbreviated as PZT, which exceeds the dielectric (K = 1700) and piezoelectric constants (d33 = 600 pC/N) of barium titanate, began to be studied <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>4. The problem with PZT is the presence of lead, which sometimes reaches up to 60% by weight of the total compound, thus leading to the search and study of other lead-free ceramic materials, such as potassium sodium niobate (K1-XNaXNbO3, abbreviated as KNN).</p><p>On the other hand, semiconductor materials, such as ceramics, have been developed for catalytic applications, specifically those procedures that are activated by sunlight, known as photocatalysts. Various materials have been used, such as oxides, arsenides, nitrides, various polymers such as polyacrylonitrile and lignin, pure elements such as silicon and phosphorus, among others. The mechanism in photocatalysis is as follows: the electrons in the valence band (VB) get excited by the energy in sunlight in a semiconductor material, which then jump to a higher energy level known as the conduction band (CB), creating a pair of electron -hole.</p><p>These pairs have enough energy to produce reduction -oxidation sites (Redox),</p><p>where the environment that surrounds the photocatalyst reacts in these sites like breaking or creating chemical bonds <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>5. Photocatalysts have been used in the treatment of atmospheric pollutants, either in aqueous media or in air, as well as in generation of solar fuels <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>6.</p><p>In this work we will delve into potassium sodium niobate (KNN), including its properties and synthesis methods, as well as polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as a support material for the ceramic material, where we seek to take advantage of the piezophotocatalytic effect of both KNN and PAN. Other concepts such as piezoelectricity and photocatalysis will be described separately, leading to the piezo-photocatalytic effect, a combination of both. This work also covers the experimental methodology by which potassium sodium niobate nanoparticles will be synthesized and embedded in carbon nanofibers from polyacrylonitrile for applications in the degradation of organic dyes.</p><p>Then, the state of the art of the different piezoelectricity values obtained is developed, from the first studies of its structure to the highest values reported so far for KNN.</p></div>

In this study, the phase diagram between potassium niobate (KNbO3) and sodium niobate (NaNbO3) as well as the lattice parameters were obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD7) in a study to understand the phase transitions at different temperatures and with different compositions between sodium and potassium.</p><p>Piezoelectric measurements of KNN began with a 50:50 ratio of K to Na.</p><p>Subsequently, this ratio was varied, where x=0.

When the electric field is removed, the domains do not return to their initial position but are slightly deflected from the direction they took according to the electric field (E). This position is known as remnant polarization and can be measured by means of an electrical hysteresis loop (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4</ref>). When the application of the electric field is initiated, the material will reach the point of maximum saturation, where, no matter how much field is applied, no further polarization can occur.</p><p>When the field is withdrawn, the polarization will start to decrease, until it reaches the coercive field (polarization equal to 0). An electric field is applied in the opposite direction, and a negative saturation polarization will also occur. Once the field is applied again in the initial direction, the cycle is repeated. Materials that have not previously been subjected to any electric field start at the origin of the graph, but never recover this initial state <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[705,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">716]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.1.">Carbon Nanofibers (CNF) Synthesis via Electrospinning</head><p>Among the various methods of nanofiber synthesis, the electrospinning technique has been mostly studied because of the terminal characteristics of the nanofibers, such as their diameter, between 10 nm and 10 m, which is related to the concentration of monomer in the solvent <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[78]</ref>. The technique consists of introducing a polymer into solvent through a syringe, where the flow is controlled with the help of an electric field.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Catalysis</head><p>For a chemical reaction to be carried out, it requires a certain energy, generally known as activation energy, which the reactants must overcome to break their bonds and form new ones, resulting in products, which are new chemical species. Certain reactions require such a high activation energy that the products do not form; in these cases, it is necessary to add an external source that lowers the activation energy, and the reaction is carried out. These external sources are known as catalysts and can be atoms, molecules, or more complex structures, such as enzymes, or even other process variables, such as temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">85]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.1.">Photocatalysis</head><p>Within catalysis, there is a process known as photocatalysis: the incidence of electromagnetic radiation, especially in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) region, which moves electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of a material.</p><p>Photocatalysis has various applications related to degradation, such as water splitting, degradation of air pollutants, and generation of biodiesel from organic waste <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[86]</ref>.

TiO2 has high stability to degradation and oxidation when in contact with sunlight, as well as being easy to synthesize by 'soft' methods, such as sol-gel. One of the disadvantages is the range in which it can absorb light, which is in the ultraviolet and blue region of the visible light spectrum, as well as rapid recombination between electron -hole pairs, which decreases its efficiency when carrying out redox reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[85]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[86]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[87]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[88]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[89]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[90]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[91]</ref>.</p><p>These disadvantages have led to the synthesis of other materials, either organic or inorganic, which have higher performance and can further expand the applications of photocatalysis, such as KNN. The photocatalytic activity of KNN has been applied mostly for dye degradation and hydrogen production. Regarding the dye degradation, Kujur et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[44]</ref> and Lun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[92]</ref> studied the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) with KNN as nanoparticles and ceramics, with an effectiveness above 90% after one hour of photocatalysis test. Another dye that has been tested is Basic Blue 41 (BB41), by <ref type="bibr">Praxedes et al.</ref>, in this case with the 50:50 composition in KNN, and an effectiveness of 95% after six hours in a basic pH (pH = 10) <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[93]</ref>. In these three cases, the nanoparticles or ceramics were poled with corona poling <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[44]</ref> or direct contact polarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">93]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.2.">Piezocatalysis</head><p>Just as solar radiation is responsible for activating the catalytic function of a photocatalytic material, piezocatalysis takes advantage of the piezoelectricity of materials to carry out catalytic processes. Piezocatalysis can occur by means of two mechanisms (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">8</ref>): by means of Band Theory (CB and VB) as in photocatalysis, and the second is the screening charge effect. The screening effect 'divides' the charges within the piezoelectric material by polarization, and the medium in which the material is located will organize its charges based on the charges on the surface of the material <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[94]</ref>. Piezocatalysis mechanism via screening effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[95]</ref>.</p><p>The piezoelectric coefficient potential used to describe piezocatalysis is known as the piezopotential, i.e. the efficiency of charges to polarize in the material in the presence of mechanical stress specifically for catalytic mechanisms.</p><p>According to the literature review, the mechanism that is mostly presented is the shielding effect, being a little more descriptive when talking about the piezocatalysis event <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">96]</ref>.</p><p>In 2006, Wang and Song synthesized zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires on an alumina substrate by placing gold droplets on the tip of the nanowires. Employing Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), the piezopotential of these nanowires was measured, for their subsequent application as electrical nanogenerators. The synthesis of this type of material at the nanoscale makes it possible to harness the mechanical energy produced by small forces such as falling raindrops or noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[97]</ref>.</p><p>This work on ZnO nanowires marks the beginning of a new application for piezoelectric materials: catalysis. In addition to zinc oxide, other ceramic materials already known for their piezoelectric coefficient have been used, such as BaTiO3, calcium titanate (CaTiO3), molybdenum selenides and sulphides (MoSe2, MoS2), and potassium sodium niobate (K1-xNaXNbO3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">95]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.3.">Piezo-photocatalysis</head><p>The piezo-photocatalysis process starts with the piezopotential in the material: the material is subjected to a mechanical deformation or stress, which promotes an electrical polarization. This polarization aligns the charges, and the electron-hole pair generation process is more effective, causing the incidence of light to activate the excitation of electrons to the conduction band. In this way, a larger number of reaction sites are available, but with much less electronic recombination due to the electrical polarization derived from piezoelectricity. In addition, the electric polarization allows a bend in the VBs and CBs, which could generate indirect bands and, thus, a greater difficulty for electronic recombination.</p><p>Most of the applications in which piezo-photocatalysis has been used are for the degradation of organic dyes, such as Rhodamine B or methylene blue, and for obtaining hydrogen from the cleavage of the water molecule <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">98]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X. Experimental Methodology 10.1. Potassium Sodium Niobate Synthesis</head><p>The synthesis of (K0.48Na0.52)NbO3 was achieved with a solid-state reaction, using potassium carbonate (K2CO3, ACS reagent ≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, BioXtra ≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) and niobium oxide (Nb2O5, 99.9%, trace metals basis, Sigma-Aldrich) as precursors.</p><p>Before weighing the precursors, and to avoid any retained humidity due to the hygroscopic nature of the potassium and sodium carbonates, these two reagents were dried in a box furnace (Carbolite Box Furnace 1100) for 24 hours at 150 °C.</p><p>The solid-state reaction was manually carried out with agate mortar, pestle, and acetone as a process control agent. After drying, a first dry mill was completed to homogenize the powder and break down agglomerates for 15 minutes. Afterward, acetone was added to the powder and milled in circular movements for 2 hours, adding more acetone when the consistency was like mud. The powder was then transferred to a 100 ml beaker and placed on top of a hot plate (Cole-Parmer StableTemp), to dry the acetone for an hour at 155 °C.</p><p>The powder was calcined in an alumina crucible in the furnace at 800 °C for one hour, with a 5 °C/minute heating and cooling rate. Lastly, the powder was broken down in the mortar for 15 minutes before packing and labelling it.</p><p>A ceramic pellet was made using a 10 mm die (Specac 10mm DIE) and pressed 15 seconds with one ton in a hydraulic press (Specac Manual Hydraulic Press). Next, the pellet was sintered in a furnace (Nabertherm 30-3000 °C) for 2 hours at 1100 °C. For piezoelectric measurements, the pellet was polished until a mirror-like surface was acquired using sandpaper. Lastly, for density determination, a caliper (Toolzone Vernier Calliper New GM-000899) was employed to measure both the thickness and the diameter of the pellet and weigh it to calculate the density.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.2.">Particle Size Reduction</head><p>As the KNN will be used as a nanofiller in the polymeric nanofibers, they need to be reduced in size, below 100 nm hence the term "nanofiller". This is done to avoid changing the morphology of the nanofibers, to have a uniform dispersion in the electrospinning solution and also to benefit from other properties that the KNN possesses: conductivity, thermal stability and mechanical properties that can be useful for the polymeric matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[96]</ref>.</p><p>The particle size was reduced via high energy milling using the calcined ceramic powder, employing a planetary mill (Fritsch Pulverisette 5) in a Teflon vial with acetone and twenty zirconia balls with a diameter of 5 mm. The cycles were divided into millings of 15 minutes and resting time of 15 minutes, to avoid the accumulation of segregated powder, as well as the internal pressure due to the acetone, until 2 hours of total milling were completed.</p><p>In total, seven full cycles were completed from 2 to 14 hours, extracting around 0.2 grams from an initial 2-gram sample after each cycle, to analyze the particle size and morphology with Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEI Inspect F) and measuring the band gap with Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Lambda35 UV-vis spectrometer). The powder was dried on a hot plate using the same process as the solid-state reaction stated in the previous section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.3.">Polyacrylonitrile Nanofibers Synthesis</head><p>To prepare the polyacrylonitrile nanofibers, a 10 wt% solution was prepared using polyacrylonitrile (PAN, Mw 150,000 Sigma-Aldrich), dissolved in N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, ≥99.5% HPLC grade, Fisher Scientific). After adding the PAN to the DMF, the solution was stirred for 24 hours at room temperature. A pristine solution of only PAN was used as a control group.</p><p>In order to prepare the composite materials, more batches of 10 wt% PAN solution were used, adding KNN nanoparticles in different weight percentages based on the PAN content (10, 20, 30, and 40 wt%). The ceramic powder was added to the solution before PAN, to avoid any agglomeration of the powder before the polymer was completely dissolved in DMF, stirring for 24 hours at room temperature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.4.">Electrospinning Technique and Stabilization</head><p>After the stirring was completed, the solution was transferred to a 12 ml syringe with a 3 cm blunt needle for the electrospinning process. A pump (World Precision Instruments) was used for a fixed 0.5 ml/hour flow, using a voltage between 15 and 17.5 kV with a direct current (DC) negative voltage source (SPELLMAN SL10) for the nanofibers production. These were collected on a flat metallic plate (20 x 30 cm), covered in an aluminum sheet. The current was connected to the end of the blunt needle and to the middle top of the metallic plate to avoid any short circuit. All the solutions were electrospun for 6 hours, using a total of 3 ml per solution.</p><p>The nanofibers mat was cut into squares of approximately 5 x 5 cm with a scalpel and stored in petri dishes. Next, a flat alumina crucible was used to support the nanofibers mat for the stabilization process, which was performed in an oven (Thermo SCIENTIFIC HERATHERM Oven) for two hours at 250 °C. The stabilization process is done on the nanofibers to form the PAN cyclization due to its chemical structure, and to make the fibers conductive, so that they are able to perform the catalysis tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.5.">Nanofibers Polarization Via Corona Poling</head><p>A corona discharge setup was used to pole and activate the piezoelectric activity in the ceramic nanoparticles and the polymeric nanofibers, both the control powder and pristine PAN samples, as well as the four composites. An array of six needles soldered to a stripboard was used as the corona electrode, to create a dome of ionized air that would serve as the ions for aligning the dipoles in the piezoelectric materials, leaving a 1 cm gap between the sample and the needles, with an electric field of 1.5 kV/mm. The samples were grounded to a metallic plate, and the polarization direction was normal to the surface of the sample.</p><p>Dependent on the humidity and temperature in the lab, the corona setup was located inside a fume hood as a safety measure, due to the equipment requiring a high voltage with DC between 11 and 14 kV for a constant 0.03 mA current. The samples were left at room temperature for 30 minutes under the corona discharge and rested for 15 minutes with the high voltage source (GLASSMAN HIGH VOLTAGE Series FR) turned off for the ozone to flow out of the setup before manipulating the samples.10</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.6.">Catalysis Tests</head><p>A rhodamine B (RhB) solution was prepared with a concentration of 10 ppm.</p><p>To avoid any degradation due to light, the volumetric flask was covered in aluminum foil and placed in a cupboard. Three catalysis tests were done on the control groups (KNN powder and pristine PAN fibers) and the composite materials: piezocatalysis, photocatalysis and piezo-photocatalysis. 15 mg of catalyst were submerged in 10 ml of the RhB solution for 30 minutes before the test began. An aliquot of 0.5 ml was extracted from a glass vessel (Adams &amp; Chittenden Scientific Glass) every 30 minutes using a micropipette, until 3 hours of catalysis were completed. The dye was also tested by itself, to analyze its behavior and changes in the concentration that could happen due to the evaporation of water.</p><p>For the piezocatalysis tests, the vessel was covered in aluminum foil and placed in an ultrasonic bath (Fisher Scientific FB15050 Ultrasonic Bath). The aluminum cover was moved aside for taking the aliquots and placed back again for the test to continue. Each aliquot was placed in a 3 ml sample vessel, left in a cardboard box to avoid degradation by light.</p><p>The photocatalysis tests required a top-down light (Newport Oriel ABB Solar</p><p>Simulator and Newport Thermo Oriel 69907 Power Supply) that worked as a solar simulator, with an intensity of 250 Watts. The vessel was covered with a quartz lid for the light to penetrate, which was also removed for every aliquot. To keep the process as standardized as possible, the height of the ultrasonic bath was measured, and a small platform was adjusted to this height for the piezophotocatalysis tests. The same storage system was employed.</p><p>Lastly, the ultrasonic bath was placed under the central section of the lamp for the piezo-photocatalysis tests, and a 100 ml beaker was used as a barrier so the vessel would not move with the vibrations. The quartz lid was left on top of the vessel in the same fashion as the photocatalysis tests and the sample vessels for aliquots storage.</p><p>After all the samples were collected, a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) vessel with a small slit for 1.5 ml samples were employed for measuring the concentration via UV-Vis spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Lambda35 UV-Vis Spectrometer), from 340 to 900 nm. The samples taken from the KNN powder control group needed to be centrifuged (Eppendorf Mini Spin Plus Centrifuge) due to the particle size below 100 nm and to avoid any noise in the measurements that could come from the powder. Once all the samples were measured, the data was processed to generate the corresponding plots.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.7.">Characterizations</head><p>For potassium sodium niobate powder, a crystallographic study was performed with X-Ray Diffraction (X'Pert Pro, CuK 1.541874 Å) to confirm the presence of a pure phase after the calcination and after each milling cycle, as well as after sintering a pellet for piezoelectric testing. X-ray diffraction was also used for the pristine fibers and the composite materials, to analyze the contribution of both materials to the X-Ray pattern. The range set in the Diffractometer was from 5 to 70° (2, with a 0.016 second step. To analyze the presence of the phases involved in the XRD, Rietveld refinement was done with the FullProf software <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[97]</ref>. To determine the lowest calcination temperature, the powder without calcination was analyzed with Thermogravimetric Analysis (Thorn Scientific STA1500), with an air atmosphere from room temperature to 1100 °C.</p><p>The powder, the pristine fibers, and the composites were observed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEI Inspect F), to analyze their morphology and measure the particle and fiber sizes, as well as the semi-quantitative atomic percentage of the elements present in the samples with an Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy detector (EDS). The fibers and composites were also analyzed the stabilization temperature with Thermogravimetric Analysis and Differential Thermal Analysis (Thorn Scientific STA1500).</p><p>With the use of Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Lambda950</p><p>UV-Vis Spectrometer), the band gap was determined for the KNN powders, measuring between 200 and 900 nm with an integrating sphere, due to the quantity of the powder available. UV-Vis was also used to measure the concentration of Rhodamine B once the dye degradation was executed for several days. Using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR Bruker Tensor 27 Spectrometer), the vibrational modules were measured for the powder, the pristine fibers, and the composites, in a range between 4500 and 500 cm -1 . Raman spectroscopy (RENISHAW inVia Raman Microscope) was also employed for the vibrational modules, helpful with the graphitic content in the nanofibers and the niobium-oxygen octahedras in the KNN structure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XI. Results and Discussion</head><p>This chapter will be divided into four sections: the results corresponding to the ceramic material (potassium sodium niobate), to the polymeric material and the composites (polyacrylonitrile), the catalysis tests and, lastly, a summary of the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.1.">Potassium Sodium Niobate (KNN)</head><formula xml:id="formula_4">11.1.1. XRD &amp; TGA-DTA</formula><p>The first approach to confirm a correct solid-state synthesis in ceramic materials is a crystallographic study, done with X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The potassium sodium niobate (KNN) composition for this project is K0.48Na0.52NbO3, which has shown an increase in the piezoelectric coefficient due to the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of various crystallographic structures, as mentioned in previous chapters. The closest KNN composition reported is K0.50Na0.50NbO3 (PDF 00-061-0315), which was used with a tetragonal (P4mm) and an orthorhombic (Amm2) structures to understand which crystalline structure was present with the 48:52 KNN composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[98]</ref>.</p><p>In the first synthesis attempts, a secondary phase appeared at the same time as the 50:50 KNN composition, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">12</ref>. This secondary phase was identified as potassium niobate (K2Nb4O11), with a tetragonal tungsten -bronze structure (TTB), which is commonly observed in solid-state reaction for KNN. The KNN perovskite has two alkaline elements in the A-site, sodium and potassium.</p><p>Sodium tends to evaporate with higher temperatures during th e calcination process, creating a secondary phase rich in potassium (K2Nb4O11). This phase has photocatalytic properties and is used as a catalyst, when synthesized by a sol -gel route <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[99]</ref>. The possible factors that could help this secondary phase to grow include: 1)</p><p>acetone not being fully evaporated after the manual milling; 2) not enough energy administered to the milling process; 3) not enough milling time; 4) incorrect program in the furnace for the calcination process; and 5) the furnace not reaching the temperature set for the calcination; and 6) water molecules stored in the reagents, due to the hygroscopic nature of the carbonates, causing a lower weight added compared to the theoretical values.</p><p>Each factor was addressed individually: 1) the powder was dried in a hot plate after the milling process, before the calcination, to avoid any humidity within the powder; 2) and 3) were discarded; 4) and 5) were monitored during the whole calcination process, confirming that the calcination temperature was actually reached and that it followed the sequence programmed in the beginning. Lastly, two new bottles of sodium and potassium niobate arrived while doing the KNN synthesis, and after using these, a pure XRD pattern of K0.48Na0.52NbO3 powder was acquired (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">13</ref>). The 48:52 composition has a slight shift to the right compared to the 50:50 composition, as the A-site has a 2% atomic difference for this project, and the position is expected to shift, but not the shape of the peaks.  Five XRD patterns were obtained for the calcination temperatures stated above. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">15</ref> includes the XRD patterns for those five samples and the indexed data for the K2Nb4O11 secondary phase and the 50:50 KNN composition. Using the 740 °C mark from the TGA-DTA, the sample calcined at 750 °C should appear without any secondary phase, but at this temperature the K2Nb4O11 phase is present, and the peaks are not sharp enough nor with the same shape, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">13</ref>.</p><p>The lowest temperature at which no visible secondary phases form in the KNN and sharp peaks are present in the pattern , at least with a 48:52 composition and following a solid-state route for its synthesis, is 800 °C. Once the pure phase at a lower temperature was acquired, a pellet was pressed and sintered at 1100 °C for two hours to calculate the density of this ceramic.</p><p>Using the diameter, height and weight of the pellet, the density of 48:52 KNN under the solid-state reaction conditions was 3.45 g/cm 3 . Other values reported for KNN pressed in a pellet with the same sintering conditions to be 4.28 g/cm 3 , as reported by Jenko et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[101]</ref>.</p><p>The next step was to reduce the particle size below 100 nm from an initial 287.25 ± 127.16 nm (this result is included in the section 11.1.3. SEM-EDS), for it to be used as part of the composite material in the electrospinning process. Before any milling was done, the Scherrer equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[102]</ref> was used to calculate the crystallite size from the XRD peaks (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">13</ref>): In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_19">3</ref>, the data obtained from the XRD pattern are shown in dependence on the peak position, with the average at the bottom. The crystallite size for a 48:52 KNN composition, calcined at 900 °C was 22.32 ± 6.69 nm. Subsequently, a planetary mill was employed to reduce the particle size, using acetone as the liquid medium. The powder was milled for 14 hours in total, taking small samples every 2 hours. The first three samples were analyzed in XRD to ensure that the secondary phase did not grow with the high energy from the milling process. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">16</ref>, the milled samples are compared to the sample without any milling post-calcination, where the lack of a secondary phase indicates that the powder is stable enough to endure high energy from agitation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.1.2.">Rietveld Refinement</head><p>As mentioned before, the potassium sodium niobate can present multiple crystalline structures, depending on the temperature at which the ceramic works. At room temperature, the most likely crystalline structure is orthorhombic, and the following structure is orthorhombic. To confirm the presence of one or another, or both phases, a Rietveld refinement with a Pseudo-Voigt peak shape was conducted on the XRD pattern shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">13</ref> using FullProf software for it <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[97]</ref>. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">4</ref>, the final results of the refinement are presented, for the lattice parameters, the angles and the cell volume, comparing both the tetragonal and the orthorhombic phase from the 48:52 to the 50:50 composition. After the refinement was completed, the residual factors (R) <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[103]</ref> resulted in Rwp = 7.99 and Rexp = 5.21, with a  2 = 2.3568.  After this analysis, a refinement was calculated individually for both the orthorhombic and the tetragonal phases, to observe closely the contribution of each to the KNN powder measured with XRD. The R factors and  2 are reported in Table</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">a) b) c)</formula><p>5, where the orthorhombic phase has a better fit to the XRD pattern compared to the tetragonal. After the high energy milling was completed, the samples were analyzed via Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), to obtain images and atomic percentage of the elements present in the samples, to confirm that the 48:52 composition was maintained before and after the milling was done. For this analysis, the control group was the sample without any post calcination milling, as shown in the group of images in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">18</ref>.</p><p>In this set of SEM images, KNN powder with different stages of postcalcination milling can be seen, including in each image the particle size distribution with the minimum and maximum values. Regarding the particles shape, the majority of the powder had a rectangular or squared form, that is softened at the edges with the milling time increase. The agglomeration that was visible in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">18a</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">18b</ref> is reduced with time as well, allowing the smaller particles to be separated from the bigger ones. Before doing the size analysis, the atomic percentage for the 48:52 composition was calculated in theory following the stoichiometric ratio, and later compared to the results from EDS. This comparison can be seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">6</ref>.</p><p>The distribution followed a normal behavior with 0, 2, 10, 12 and 14 hours with negative skewness in 0 and 12 hours and positive skewness in 2 and 14 hours, having a scattered trend between 4 and 6 hours of milling. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">18</ref>  Using the ImageJ software <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[104]</ref>, the particle size was measured for each sample, from 0 to 14 hours of post-calcination milling (8 samples in total), with 300 individual measurements to obtain the average particle size listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">6</ref>. The Table shows that all samples have a high standard deviation, due to a large distribution in size of the particles within the powder; this could be due to particles that were stuck to the walls of the vessel for the majority of the milling time, and came lose after taking samples out for their measurement in SEM. It can be concluded that the post-calcination milling is working, but it would require more time, even up to 24 hours or more to reach the average particle size mark of 100 nm required for the project, as a smaller particle size is better for the morphology of the nanofibers.  While working with the EDS, general and punctual measurements were conducted on each sample, showing that with a higher post-calcination milling time, the atomic percentages are closer to the theoretical value for a 48:52 composition,</p><p>shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">7</ref>. The oxygen and niobium percentages are the two elements that change the most in the samples, stabilizing around 4 and 6 hours. This could be due to the sampling before the measurements, or probably oxygen vacancies due to the amount of energy supplied during the milling process. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.1.4.">UV-Vis</head><p>The nature of the project and the application for the composites require knowledge of the optical band gap of the material. For this, the powder was measured in reflectance mode in a UV-Vis spectrometer with an integrating sphere, using the Tauc method to obtain the energy value:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(𝛼 • ℎ𝜈) 1/𝛾 = 𝐵(ℎ𝜈 -𝐸 𝑔 )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>optical band gap has been reported to be around 2.9 eV for an average grain size of 270 nm, using the solid-state reaction for its synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[92]</ref>.</p><p>This slight change could originate from the possibility that the smaller particles were not extracted from the sample, but rather the whole range of particle size was sandwiched between two slides of microscope glass. Correlating the band gap with the average particle size for each sample, the following data are compared: for 0 hours, the average particle size is 287.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. FT-IR</head><p>FT-IR spectra were obtained for KNN powders before and after it was calcined. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">20a</ref>, presents two peaks in 2339 and 2359 cm -1 , that correspond to the interaction between carbon and oxygen, usually related to the carbon dioxide molecule (CO2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[106]</ref>. This could be due to two reasons: firstly, the appearance of CO2 in the spectrum as background noise when running a background check in the FT-IR equipment; secondly, is the carbon -oxygen double bond (C=O), with an asymmetric stretch, coming from the sodium and potassium carbonates used as reagents for the KNN synthesis.</p><p>This peak does not appear in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">20b</ref>, which shows the IR spectrum for     <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[110]</ref>. Using the Fityk software <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[111]</ref> a deconvolution was done to the peaks with a Voigt function, obtaining Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">21 a</ref>). With this deconvolution, it can be seen that there is a peak that was not considered in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">8</ref>, around 201 cm - 1 that would correspond to F2u, and the first peak shifts to the left and is at 135 instead of 142 cm -1 , which then should belong to an A1 vibrational mode, mentioned by Saha et al. to be around 131 cm -1 in their theoretical study <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[109]</ref>. The other peaks do not shift compared to the deconvolution. In Even though it was mentioned above that there are 27 phonon vibrations, when analyzing Saha's study <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[109]</ref> only 14 of these have Raman intensities above 0.01, and five of these 14 present intensities above 0.10, which coincide with those reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">8</ref>. At least five peaks are visible before doing the deconvolution, where an additional peak can be perceived at a lower value, between the first two peaks in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">8</ref> (142.00 and 248.78 cm -1 ). This extra peak is located around 200 cm -1 , which corresponds to a B1 vibration, and the 142 cm -1 peak is an A1 vibration or the movement of alkali elements (sodium and potassium) within the niobiumoxygen octahedra.  (2), which also decreases in intensity with a higher amount of KNN. A possible explanation for this correlates with the TGA results, which will be discussed further down in this section.</p><p>The peaks for 30 and 40 wt% KNN composites lose the sharpness, quite visible in the peaks between 45° and 60° (2), as well as the peak at 22° (2). This could be due to the agglomeration that was also visible with the SEM images and how the particles are covered by the PAN nanofibers. This, as previously mentioned, could be a reduction in the crystallization of the PAN due to a higher ceramic load within the fibers. In 2021, Doumeng et al. studied the effect of four different fillers in polyetheretherketone composites, a polymer used for its stiffness. One of the fillers was alumina, where it showed that by increasing the particle load into the composite from 2.5 to 5 wt%, a reduction in crystallinity from 43.1 to 33.1% was observed in the XRD patterns. They conclude that due to a higher particle load, there is less opportunity for the particles to move in the polymer and create a stress in the a) b) nucleation process, hence the reduction in the crystallinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[114]</ref>. The agglomeration of KNN particles could also present this behavior, as the particles have a lower surface area where the PAN can interact with and a lower crystallization activity as a consequence. Due to the organic nature of the fibers, measuring them in TGA-DTA resulted in a helpful way of understanding how the ceramic nanoparticles were impacting the weight changes in correlation with the temperature at which the fibers were subjected. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">24</ref>, all the curves are shown between 50 and 900 °C in a nitrogen (N2) atmosphere, with fibers that did not receive any thermal treatment, also known as stabilization. 115116117All the samples, up until 250 °C, are quite stable to the temperature increase, but after this point the first weight drop is noticeable, even though it does not happen at the same temperature for all the samples. This first weight loss is due to the cyclization in the PAN structure, where the nitrogen in the nitrile groups (-C≡N) bonds with the carbon in the nitrile group next to it, leading to the formation of an aromatic ring, as explained by Jin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[102]</ref>.</p><p>After this change in the chemical structure, the fibers continue to lose weight until 900 °C; this temperature was chosen as the upper limit because it would not have any effect on the ceramic particles. The remaining weight was mostly the KNN added to the solution and the fibers ashes. The composite that has the least weight loss is 20 wt% with a remanent weight of 39%, whereas the 30 wt% has the highest weight loss with a remanent weight of 18%. This behavior could be due to the fibers collection site, as the mid-section of the mat after being collected in the aluminum foil has the highest concentration of fibers and particles as well. As a composite, the properties of the material will change due to adding a different compound, and in this case, the ceramic particles had a direct effect on the stabilization temperature mentioned above. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">9</ref>, the stabilization temperatures are listed for the pristine fibers, as well as the composites, going from 10, 20, 30 to 40 wt% of KNN in the solutions. The weight loss curve for the 40 wt% KNN composite has a less defined drop around 265 °C, compared to the same weight drop around 300 °C for the pristine fibers.</p><p>The difference between the stabilization temperature in pristine fibers and the 40 wt% composite is 33.56 °C, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">9</ref>. The decrease in the stabilization temperature is almost linear, even though the difference between the 20 and 30 wt% KNN composites are quite close to each other. Nevertheless, the decrease in the stabilization temperature is attributed to the presence of ceramic particles, that are known for being resistant to high temperatures, thus helping in the nanofibers stabilization process by needing less energy to cycle the chemical structure with the nitrile groups. An example of this behavior in other polymers was studied by Torres-Giner and Lagaron, in 2010, where they synthesized composite materials from zein electrospun nanofibers, a type of protein found in maize, and different clay nanofillers: kaolinite, montmorillonite, mica and zeolite. The purpose of this study was to analyze the thermal and mechanical properties of the fibers with different ceramic content in the fibers. The glass transition temperature (Tg), also known as stabilization temperature, from the pure fibers was 158.90 °C, and by adding even 1 wt% of any of the ceramic nanofillers in different batches, reduced by 1 °C, and up to 3 °C in the case of the zeolite nanofiller (155.16 °C). In this case, the authors mention that ceramic fillers act as reinforcing plasticizers, helping the polymeric stabilization to occur at a lower temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[118]</ref>.</p><p>With a higher ceramic load, the stabilization temperature decreases, not allowing the nitrile groups cyclisation in PAN to happen consistently. The temperature registered for the 40 wt% KNN composite was 264 °C, and the temperature used for the stabilization of all the samples was 250 °C; this closeness in the temperatures could explain the loss of sharpness in the peaks in the XRD patterns from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">23</ref>. A Rietveld refinement would help understanding which proportion of the tetragonal and orthorhombic structures from the KNN is present in the 30 and 40 wt% KNN composites. Comparing the TGA-DTA plots from which the information from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">9</ref> was collected, the exothermic peak for the stabilization temperature in the 40 wt% composite shifts to the left of the pristine PAN sample in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_36">25</ref>. Another noticeable difference is that the specific heat flow in the 40 wt% KNN sample is less than that of pristine PAN, also attributed to the presence of a ceramic material as the filling in the composite. The sharp peak in the DTA curves has an exothermic nature related to the cyclization of the nitrile groups in PAN. When the ceramic nanoparticles load increases, the peak loses sharpness, and the overall DTA curve in 40 wt% KNN does not go higher than 40 W/g, that could also correlate to the presence of a ceramic material in the composite, compared to almost 80 W/g at the end of the pristine fibers graph. Also, the content of ashes should be higher in the case of the composites, as the ceramic does not suffer a loss in mass at this temperature. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.2.2.">SEM</head><p>To confirm that the nanoparticles are indeed being distributed in the fibers after the electrospinning process, the samples were analyzed in SEM, to both observe the distribution and calculate the fibers diameter, as this parameter can be a) b)</p><p>changed with the concentration of the solution, the humidity and electric field administered to the deposition. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">26</ref>, images from the different samples are presented, and in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">10</ref> the diameter size is included per sample.</p><p>Due to the use of a flat collector for the electrospun fibers, the array of these is completely random, from the pristine fibers to those with ceramic nanoparticles.</p><p>Some of the pristine fibers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">26a</ref>) bend in sharp angles, while others intertwine between themselves, that could be due to stress from the electrospinning process, or stress derived from the shrinkage after the stabilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[119]</ref>. Starting with the 10 wt% composite material, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">26b</ref> there are two main characteristics that are present in the fibers: the particles within the fibers and what appears to be a balloon shape. This balloon appears in the fibers when the voltage is too high while electrospinning the solution.</p><p>The agglomerations vary in size and shape in the composite samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">26b</ref>, 26c, 26d and 26e), and this could be related to the static nature of the powder.</p><p>While manipulating the KNN powder for weighing it, for example, it would disperse in the air when in contact with laboratory gloves. Furthermore, the use of the corona discharge for poling the powder would make it disperse in the air. The voltage used for the electrospinning process was between 15 and 17.5 kV, which could have concentrated the powder in the manner observed in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">26d</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_36">25e</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, with the growth of the agglomerations, the nanoparticles tend to fold at the edges in the way a plastic product scorches. This could indicate that, with a bigger agglomerate, the nanoparticles would look to form a micelle as a more stable structure, although this behavior was not observed in any of the samples.</p><p>Another interesting conduct from the fibers is that the polymeric matrix tried to wrap the particles together (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">26d</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">26e</ref>), some even going to the point of electrospinning a fiber at the ends of the agglomerate, as observed at the bottom of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">26d</ref>. The distribution of ceramic particles appears to cover the surface almost homogeneously, and the agglomeration could even be beneficial for the catalysis process by having a higher surface area of nanoparticles acting as redox sites. Looking at the average diameter of the fibers, the inclusion of ceramic nanoparticles changes the viscosity of the solution, and it even affected the voltage at which the solution was electrospun, starting with 17.5 kV and needing to reduce to 15 kV. This reduction was due to the presence of solution droplets in the aluminum foil, and these droplets indicate that the voltage is too high, so the solution does not have enough time to form a fiber but rather just gets spit out of the syringe. With a lower voltage, the fibers get thicker as seen in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">10</ref>.</p><p>Zhang et al., in 2012, created a correlation list between electrospinning conditions and its effect on the fibers diameter. To contradict what was seen in this project, they listed that with a higher voltage, the fibers get thicker, as does increasing the viscosity in the solution. This last point is what could be affecting the electrospinning of the KNN -PAN composite solution, as the voltage apparently did not behave as predicted by Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[120]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.2.3.">FT-IR</head><p>Five distinctive peaks can be attributed to the PAN fibers in the IR spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[112]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.2.4.">Raman Spectroscopy</head><p>Measuring the fibers with Raman turned out quite challenging: the fibers would burn where the laser was placed, and even though the parameters of intensity and the lasers were changed, only two samples could be measured and, even after finishing, they looked melted. Two distinguishable peaks with the shape of "cat ears" are present in both spectra, corresponding to D and G (E2g2) vibrational modes are shown Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">28</ref>. In polymeric materials, these two bands are related to the graphitic degree of the samples. Due to the stabilization process, the fibers indeed possess a level of graphitic layers in them, but with the composite materials these bands appear higher and with a slight shift to the right.</p><p>Correlating with the results from TGA-DTA, the reduction in the stabilization temperature by the inclusion of ceramic particles in a polymeric matrix causes a shift and an increase in the graphitic vibrational modes. The peaks that appeared in the KNN powder, discussed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">21</ref>, were expected to appear in the composite material, but it could be that the small particles are not large enough to appear in the composite spectrum like they did in the bulk sample. The rise in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">28b</ref> at the end of the axis was not identified. The samples were analyzed in SEM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">30</ref>) to observeview better the holes and how they affected the fibers. From Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">30a</ref>, more holes are visible, covering the surface of pristine fibers, not only on a visible distance with the naked eye, and looking with a higher magnification (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">30b</ref>), the edges of the holes are melted and the fibers underneath the hole as well. Indicating that corona poling parameters were set too high, and it burned the sample. It is interesting that the corona poling affected the sample in small holes, instead of melting the sample in general. This could be that these holes appeared in places where the volume of fibers was less dense, but also that the discharges from the corona poling looked for the easiest pathway to the sample, which had the most conductive regions in the surface.</p><p>a) b) 500 m 20 m Figures 30c and 30d correspond to the 30 wt% KNN composite and the holes have a rounder shape, but in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">30d</ref> it can be observed that the KNN nanoparticles are unveiled from the charred fibers. This could have a direct effect on the degradation capacity, but further tests would be needed to conclude this. Also, it could be that the particles, being so static, help the ionized air from the corona poling to concentrate in specific areas, as the particles do not seem affected by the discharge as the fibers do.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.3.">Catalysis Tests</head><p>The control groups for the catalysis tests were the pristine PAN fibers, and the KNN powder, while the Rhodamine B (RhB) was tested by itself in the same manner as the rest of the samples. After the fibers were used for the first set of catalysis tests (piezocatalysis), they were dried on a hot plate to evaporate the water, and were reused for the photocatalysis and, after, the piezo-photocatalysis tests. The KNN powder could not be recovered after each test, due to the particle size and its deposition at the bottom of the vessel, so new powder from the same batch needed to be poled and used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.3.1.">Piezocatalysis</head><p>From the three catalytic tests, the piezocatalysis activity had the most abnormal performance in almost all the cases, and this could have been due to the c) 200 m d) 2.5 m water evaporation from the energy of the ultrasonic bath, leading to an increase in the dye concentration. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_42">31</ref>, the list of samples is shown between 0 and 180 min, which is the length of the tests set for this project, and what has been used in several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[121]</ref>. RhB was evaluated by itself, to be able to discern that the samples were degrading the dye, and it was not due to the behavior of the solution in a constant stressed and heated environment.</p><p>If we consider the dye as a baseline, there are three candidates that perform better below the dye line (black line in the graph): pristine PAN, KNN powder and 10 wt% KNN composite. Before beginning this project, while doing a literature review, the option that the polyacrylonitrile was a piezoelectric polymer was even considered while looking for background information, but after this catalytic activity test, a review was written by Tao et al. at the end of 2023 <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[122]</ref>. In this review, several studies prove that PAN can be used as a piezoelectric material, but the majority focused more on its mechanical properties as a high resistance polymer rather than the piezoelectric properties.</p><p>With this latest information, the composite materials should have an enhanced piezoelectric activity, a combination from both the ceramic and the polymeric materials. Counting only with one set of results from this test, the 10 wt% KNN composite could be said to have a piezoelectric activity coming more from the PAN fibers than the KNN particles, as the quantity of KNN is based on the weight percentage of PAN in the solution rather than the solvent.</p><p>The rest of the composite materials had a weak performance, mostly the 40 wt% KNN sample. In the 30 and 40 wt% cases, compared to the others, the concentration goes up in the 60-minute mark, and they tend to stay above the concentration in the 30-minute mark, with an absorbance of 21.84% for 30 wt% KNN and 36.69% for 40 wt% KNN samples. These results could correlate to the crystallization of the fibers, as was seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">23</ref>, were less crystalline materials have a decrease in the degradation ability. All the samples have a lower relative concentration at the end of the test (180 min ) compared to the dye. More tests would be required to know if the data obtained in the first place is correct, and it could be that the rest of the samples have a better performance than what is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_42">31</ref>.</p><p>In the piezocatalysis case, the best performers were the control groups (pristine PAN and KNN powder), and the 10 wt% KNN composite. For the 10 wt% composite, the initial absorbance was 100%, and the absorbance after 180 of catalytic activity was 23.29%, which translates into a 76.71% removal efficiency after 3 hours. The efficiency in the control groups were 69.14% with pristine PAN fibers, and 61.40% with KNN powder.</p><p>No visible color changes were observed in any of the cases, even though some of the samples should be almost as clear as water, all remained a bright pink shade, maybe due to lack in catalysis-action time. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.3.2.">Photocatalysis</head><p>Continuing with the photocatalytic activity tests, the performance was weaker than in piezocatalysis, but the catalytic behavior seems more stable, like pristine PAN and KNN powder, which are the control groups. A visible difference between the piezo-and the photocatalysis tests is that the dye is more stable under direct light, as it evaporates less water compared to the ultrasonic bath, which indicates that the samples are degrading the dye more effectively than the heat in the system, as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_44">32</ref>.</p><p>The 90-minute mark shows a change in the path of the composite materials, in some decreasing the absorbance drastically (10 wt% KNN) and in others increasing the absorbance (20, 30 and 40 wt% KNN). This could be due to an increase in the concentration of the dye due to the light shining above the vessel and evaporating the solvent. Nevertheless, the composites increase their dye degradation capacity, as the 20 and 30 wt% have a better performance than 10 wt%, which was the best in the piezocatalysis section. The trend for this catalysis test, and the other ones, was expected to be a linear behavior, due to the increase of the ceramic load. Regarding the control groups, the KNN powder has a better removal capacity compared to the pristine PAN.</p><p>Potassium sodium niobate has been previously used as a photocatalyst for Rhodamine B degradation, a study by Kujur et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[44]</ref> were able to degrade RhB up to 89.5% with KNN powder synthesized via solid-state reaction. In this work, the best performers were KNN powder, 10 and 30 wt% KNN composites, considering the removal efficiency at the end of the test and their overall trend. Their removal percentages were 71.23% for 30 wt% KNN, 67.05% for KNN powder, and 55.54%</p><p>for 10 wt% KNN composite. Compared to the piezocatalysis tests, the efficiency is almost the same, but the behavior is more stable, as mentioned before.</p><p>As piezocatalysis, after the photocatalysis samples were measured, no visible change in the coloration was appreciated. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.3.3.">Piezo-photocatalysis</head><p>Finally, the piezo-photocatalysis tests combined the piezoelectric and the photocatalytic properties of both KNN and PAN, and the results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_45">33</ref>.</p><p>The first sample that is seemingly the best of the group, is the KNN powder, staying at the same concentration for almost three hours, which could indicate that less time would be required to degrade the dye instead of staying in the solution for 3 hours. Another sample that has a great trend is the other control sample, PAN. It is not as effective as KNN at the beginning, but at the end, it shows a similar reduction in dye concentration. From the composite materials, and from previous catalytic tests, adding above 30 wt% of KNN load into the electrospinning solution is not effective for dye degradation compared to samples that have a lower ceramic load, such as 10 wt% in piezocatalysis, and 10 and 30 wt% in photocatalysis.</p><p>Furthermore, this could be correlated to the difficulty of electrospinning the 40 wt% KNN solution and its appearance before stabilizing the sample. The 30 and 40 wt% KNN samples were less effective than the control groups.</p><p>Lastly, 10 and 20 wt% composites had a degradation capacity comparable to the pristine PAN, but the 20 wt% sample had a higher degradation capacity after 120 min. This is why it was chosen, side by side with the control groups, to repeat the tests and measure that it was the best performer from this composites group. Also, the 10 wt% KNN sample started to show a bleached color in the overall surface, which will be shown in the next section. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_46">34</ref> the second and third repetition are shown. Using the piezophotocatalytic measurement of the RhB, each graph shows four samples: the pristine PAN and KNN powder (control groups), and the 20 wt% KNN composite. As observed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_45">33</ref>, the composite material shows a similar degradation capacity to that of the pristine fibers, with the KNN powder still being the leader in the piezophotocatalysis activity. In the KNN case, it has both the piezoelectric and the  Looking at the results from the control groups and the composite material chosen to repeat the piezo-photocatalytic test (20 wt% KNN), an average absorbance value was calculated for these three cases, shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">11</ref>. Even though the KNN powder showed the best performance, the 20 wt% KNN composite was the only one that showed a distinct color change in its samples, as will be discussed in the next section.  In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">11</ref>, the asterisk mark (*) at the 30 min aliquot of KNN powder has a high standard deviation because when recovering the liquid after centrifuging the powder, part of the liquid was lost and the measurement in UV-Vis was practically the same as of water, and as it can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_46">34 b</ref>).</p><p>As a conclusion to these tests, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">35</ref> the UV-Vis spectra for the control groups and the 20 wt% KNN composite are shown. Before, it was mentioned that the piezo-photocatalysis tests were the weaker among the catalytic tests, but with the 20 wt% KNN sample there was a behavior with the two high est peaks of RhB that were not seen in any other sample, and this was part of the reason why it was chosen to repeat the piezo-photocatalysis tests.</p><p>The onset for RhB is 550 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[28]</ref>, but for the most part of the samples, this onset went from 554 nm down to 530, creating a shift towards blue that is even more visible in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">35c</ref>, the one corresponding to 20 wt% KNN sample. From the same study where they used KNN powder <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[28]</ref>, the behavior of the dye degradation is more like the pristine PAN sample, a decrease in the main peak around 550 nm, and the shoulder to the left of it also reduces its size. The shoulder around 500 nm and   The mats were evaluated with FT-IR after being used several times in the tests, and their spectra is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">37</ref>. For the pristine PAN sample, the appearance of a belly in the region of 3500 cm -1 could indicate that the fibers were absorbing part of the dye and water from the solution, and even after being dried in a hot plate at 90 °C for 15 minutes, they presented some form of degradation, but more studies of are required to be able to confirm that this degradation is taking place: accelerated aging tests under UV conditions, gas chromatography to analyze decomposition products, and oxidative induction time. In the case of the 10 wt% composite, the peaks are drastically reduced, compared to the other composites that still present a similar shape to those in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">23</ref>. While looking at the images below The same camera model (Canon EOS 1300D) from the dye samples was used for taking comparison pictures between fibers from the same batch before and after the catalysis tests. While preparing the mats for the tests, all were equally weighed to be 15 mg, but some mats were bigger than the others, as they did not have the same volume of fibers. For example, pristine PAN, 20 wt% and 40 wt% mats were the biggest in size compared to 10 wt% and 30 wt%. To have 15 mg of the mats, they needed to be cut, and the comparison images have smaller strips from the same batches, so that all the samples would have the same conditions for the degradation tests.</p><p>The effect of the corona poling, and the absorption of the dye, can be seen mostly in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_52">38</ref>, corresponding to pristine PAN mats. Smaller holes can be seen in the edges of the fibers, presumably due to the lower volume of fibers that appeared after the corona poling was done. The other mats also presented these holes, but they are more visible in the pristine sample. Continuing with Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_52">38c</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_52">38e</ref>, some darker circles appeared in the surface. A darker shade could indicate the places where the dye was absorbed, but also could be related to the agglomeration of ceramic nanoparticles discussed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">26</ref>. Another explanation could be that the concentration of dye occurred in the holes left by the corona poling (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">30</ref>), but with the current tools and measurements it would be difficult to confirm that this is what happened to the mats. Measuring uncalcined powder with Thermogravimetric Analysis -Differential Thermal Analysis, the lowest calcination temperature that preserved a pure crystalline phase was 800 °C. The density in bulk of 48:52 composition sintered at 1100 °C for two hours was 3.45 g/cm 3 . The ceramic particles were observed with Scanning Electron Microscopy, and with the use of the Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy the atomic percentage of sodium, potassium, niobium, and oxygen was calculated. After 6 hours of postcalcination milling, the atomic percentage of the elements was close to the theoretical values.</p><p>The particle size was reduced via high -energy post-calcination milling, and a filter with 0.1 m pore size was used to obtain only particles below 100 nm in size for the electrospinning solutions. Using the 0, 6 and 12-hours milled powder in Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy, the optical band gap for the potassium sodium niobate resulted in 3.94 eV for the powder after 0 hours of milling, and 3.92 eV after 12 hours of milling. With the reduction of the particle size, the optical band gap of this ceramic powder decreased by 0.02 eV after 12 hours of high energy postcalcination milling, calculated with Kulbeka-Munk modified Tauc plot.</p><p>It was confirmed with the use of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy that potassium sodium niobate loses the organic matter after the calcination, as the organic bonds at 2339 and 2359 cm -1 from the reagents disappear and the interaction between niobium and oxygen showed a deep peak at 615 cm -1 . The vibrational modules were measured with Raman Spectroscopy, and as happened with Infrared Spectroscopy, the 48:52 composition had a left shift compared to the 50:50 composition. With Raman it was also confirmed that one of the phases present in the KNN is the spatial group Amm2, an orthorhombic structure; the vibrations correspond to the Nb-O6 octahedra and movement in the alkali elements within the structure at 142 cm -1 .</p><p>The polyacrylonitrile fibers were successfully electrospun with a voltage of 17.5 kV, reduced to 15 kV once the ceramic load for the composite mats increased.</p><p>The fibers and composites were measured with X-Ray Diffraction, where the two polyacrylonitrile peaks in 17° and 29° (2) were presented, but lacked sharpness compared to the background. Once the ceramic nanoparticles were included in the solution, these peaks gained sharpness but were reduced above 30 wt% ceramic load. The niobate peaks also appeared in the composite material but, as was the case with the polyacrylonitrile peaks, the lost sharpness, and the peaks above 45° (2) changed their form.</p><p>The increasing ceramic load reduced the stabilization temperature, from 298.36 °C in pristine fibers, to 264.80 °C with a 40 wt% niobate load, but did not affect the pristine fibers peaks in Infrared Spectroscopy. The only visible change was the increase of the niobium-oxygen bond with a higher ceramic load. Regarding the vibrational modes in Raman, only the vibrations related to the graphitic structure of the fibers appeared, and the presence of the potassium sodium niobate increased the intensity of the peaks. A correlation could exist between the reduction in the stabilization temperature and the intensity increase in the Raman vibrational modes of the fibers and the composites.</p><p>Once the nanoparticles were electrospun with the polymeric solution and stabilized, the fibers were observed with Scanning Electron Microscopy, where the agglomeration of the particles was clearly observed, but they were still distributed among the fibers with the load increase. When the agglomerate was bigger in size, it tended to bend as to create a micelle, and it could be related to the static nature of the nanoparticles and the voltage at which the electrospinning process took place.</p><p>After the samples were poled with the corona effect, visible holes were observed in the fibers surface, and with Scanning Electron Microscopy it was concluded that the fibers were melted at the edges and on the layers underneath the holes. The nanoparticles were unveiled where the fibers retracted in a charred manner rather than melted.</p><p>Continuing with the catalysis tests, the best performers in piezocatalysis were 10 wt% KNN composite (76.71% removal efficiency), pristine PAN (69.14%) and KNN powder (61.40%); in photocatalysis were 30 wt% KNN (71.23%), KNN powder (67.05%), and 10 wt% KNN composite (55.54%). Lastly, the principal test for this project, piezo-photocatalysis, had the following samples as best performers: KNN powder (54.02%), 20 wt% KNN composite (45.46%) and pristine PAN (43.67%). The only visible change in the dye color was with the 20 wt% KNN sample after the third piezo-photocatalytic test, going from a bright pink to a washed yellow, almost transparent.</p></div>

These agglomeration were exposed after the corona poling was done, after increasing the temperature of the polymer and shrinking the fibers.</p><p>By poling the samples with corona discharge, the nanoparticles were exposed after the voltage burned the PAN nanofibers, which could lead to a higher efficiency in the catalysis tests by increasing the reaction area of the KNN particles.The addition of 20 wt% from K0.48Na0.52NbO3 ceramic nanoparticles obtained from a solid-state route to a 10 wt% polyacrylonitrile solution and synthesized via electrospinning, can degrade Rhodamine B with 45.46% efficiency after three hours with piezo-photocatalysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XIII. Recommendations</head><p>A mechanical study of the fibers can be used to elucidate if the ceramic nanoparticles have any effect on the mechanical properties, as well as contact angle measurement for these hydrophilic fibers.</p><p>If a higher ceramic load is to be electrospun, reducing the PAN concentration or modifying the voltage are key for a successful fibers production , which can also be measured with rheology.</p><p>Other sets of applications can be explored for these composite materials, such as the energy conversion potential and HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filters for industry wastes.</p><p>To have a better view of the degradation, the piezo-and photocatalysis tests need to be repeated to have an average, as well as the rest of the composite materials that were not used in the second and third repetition. The subproducts from the Rhodamine B degradation need to be studied in case these can be further degraded or do not present any other harmful property.</p><p>Another test that could be useful for these fibers is to determine how many cycles these fibers are resistant for, comparing the 20 and 40 wt% KNN samples, where the first resisted five tests and the second only resisted three tests before degrading.</p><p>Finally, the reaction mechanism of the KNN + PAN composites could be studied to understand the effect that it has on Rhodamine B and, furthermore, if it could be used for other dyes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>10 IIFigure 1 . 16 Figure 2 .</head><label>101162</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Raman SpectroscopyContinuing with vibrational modes, the KNN powder was analyzed with Raman spectroscopy, using a 442 nm laser, obtaining Figure21. In this spectrum, 5 distinctive peaks can be observed, which are compared to other experimental data from a 50:50 KNN composition. This comparison is made to observe a shift, as was the case in XRD, where the peaks shifted towards the right with a 48:52 composition, as shown in Table 8<ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[55]</ref>. For the KNN, the orthorhombic phase has 27 optical phonon vibrations, as mentioned by Saha et al.<ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[108]</ref>, in a theoretical and experimental study done for a 50:50 composition in 2024.

It has been tested that with the reduction of the particle size, it is possible to reduce the optical band gap as well, as done by Kujur et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[44]</ref>. As shown in the plots, and what was initially stated in the hypothesis of this work, the band gap should reduce with the particle size reduction.

This is the only case where this happened, and it could be concluded that the thinner the mat is, the easier it is for the light to perforate a hole and degrade the sample. From the FT-IR spectrum (Figure <ref type="figure">37</ref>), the measurement was taken from the edge where the hole was, but there does not appear to be a difference in the composition of the fibers. In Figure <ref type="figure">39</ref>, an image taken from above the vessel after the piezo-photocatalysis test was finished shows that the mat was only pierced in the center, but once it was removed from the liquid, it broke apart, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure">39 b</ref>). Overall, the 20 wt% KNN composite had the highest performance from the composite materials group in the piezo-photocatalysis test with a second place, behind the KNN powder, and even though it was similar in size as the 40 wt% sample, it did not suffer any destruction after 5 catalytic tests, compared to the 3 tests that the 40 wt% KNN composite underwent.</p></div>
